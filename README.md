Bedrock Runtime Python Client
This repository contains a Python client for interacting with Bedrock, a platform for building and deploying AI models. With this client, you can easily send requests to Bedrock models and receive responses.

Installation
To use this client, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

boto3: A Python SDK for AWS (Amazon Web Services).
awscli: The AWS Command Line Interface.
botocore: The low-level, core functionality of boto3.
You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
%pip install "boto3>=1.28.57" "awscli>=1.29.57" "botocore>=1.31.57"
Getting Started
To get started with this client, you will need to import the necessary libraries and create a connection to the Bedrock service.

python
Copy code
import boto3
import json

# Create a connection to the Bedrock service
bedrock = boto3.client(service_name='bedrock-runtime')
Next, you can prepare a request to send to a Bedrock model. In this example, we are sending a prompt to an AI model and receiving a response.

python
Copy code
# Prepare the request body
body = json.dumps({
    "prompt": "\n\nHuman:explain black holes to 8th graders\n\nAssistant:",
    "max_tokens_to_sample": 300,
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "top_p": 0.9,
})

# Specify the model to use
modelId = 'anthropic.claude-v2'

# Set the content type for the request and response
accept = 'application/json'
contentType = 'application/json'

# Send the request to the Bedrock model
response = bedrock.invoke_model(body=body, modelId=modelId, accept=accept, contentType=contentType)

# Parse the response
response_body = json.loads(response.get('body').read())

# Print the generated text
print(response_body.get('completion'))
Make sure to customize the body, modelId, and other parameters according to your specific use case.
